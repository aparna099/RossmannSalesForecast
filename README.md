# RossmannSalesForecast

## Problem Statement
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

## Dataset Description
You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

### Files
train.csv - historical data including Sales
test.csv - historical data excluding Sales
store.csv - supplemental information about the stores

### Data fields
Most of the fields are self-explanatory. The following are descriptions for those that aren't.

*Id - an Id that represents a (Store, Date) duple within the test set

Customers - the number of customers on a given day
Open - an indicator for whether the store was open: 0 = closed, 1 = open
